The following project was built with Eclipse IDE as a Maven project.
The language I'm choosing to code is Java.
I'm using Cucumber to create the feature of the test case.
The pom.xml has all the references to Selenium, Cucumber and JUnit versions.
I chose Google Chrome as the browser so I need chromedriver.exe 
                                     in the following folder -> C:\Librerias\BrowserDrivers
This project can run as a Maven project or a JUnit project providing the dependencies of 
                                                           the pom file are downloaded.
